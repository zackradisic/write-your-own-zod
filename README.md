# Write your own Zod

Accompanying source code for a [written tutorial series](https://zackoverflow.dev/writing/write-your-own-zod) on writing your own implementation of [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) from scratch.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.1. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
